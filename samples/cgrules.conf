# /etc/cgrules.conf
#
#Each line describes a rule for a user in the form:
#
#<user>   <controllers>		<destination>
#
#Where:
#<user> can be:
#        - an user name
#        - a group name, with @group syntax
#        - the wildcard *, for any user or group.
#        - The %, which is equivalent to "ditto". This is useful for
#          multiline rules where different cgroups need to be specified
#          for various hierarchies for a single user.
#
# <controller> can be:
# 	 - comma separated controller names (no spaces)
# 	 - * (for all mounted controllers)
#
# <destination> can be:
# 	 - path with-in the controller hierarchy (ex. pgrp1/gid1/uid1)
#
# Note:
# - It currently has rules only based on uids and gids.
#
# - Don't put overlapping rules. First rule which matches the criteria
#   will be executed.
#
# - Multiline rules can be specified for specifying different cgroups
#   for multiple hierarchies. In the example below, user "peter" has
#   specified 2 line rule. First line says put peter's task in test1/
#   dir for "cpu" controller and second line says put peter's tasks in
#   test2/ dir for memory controller. Make a note of "%" sign in second line.
#   This is an indication that it is continuation of previous rule.
#
#
#<user>  	<controllers>  	<destination>
#
#john          cpu		usergroup/faculty/john/
#@student      cpu,memory	usergroup/student/
#peter	       cpu		test1/
#%	       memory		test2/
#@root	    	*		admingroup/
#*		*		default/
