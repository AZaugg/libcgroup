Libcgroup release procedure
===========================
Please follow the following steps (TODO: Automate these steps)
1. Check, that every new or changed feature since last release is reflected in
   README and/or man pages.
2. Bump soname of libcgroup shared objects if needed - LIBRARY_VERSION_MAJOR,
   _MINOR and _RELEASE in configure.in.
3. Prepare release candidate (X.YY-rcZ - X.YY = version, Z - prerelease
umber):
	a. Update AC_INIT(X.YY.rcZ) in configure.in.
	b. Run 'autoreconf -i' to generate the configure file again, with the
	   new release number.
	c. Run './configure' to generate Makefile and dist/libcgroup.spec with
	   correct version numbers.
	d. Run 'make dist' to create tarball. Fix Makefile.am files if
	   something goes wrong.
	   The tarball should contain everything needed for compilation with
	   simple sh, make and (optionally) rpmbuild, among others:
	   	libcgroup-X.YY.rcZ/configure
		libcgroup-X.YY.rcZ/dist/libcgroup.spec
	e. Try to build rpms ('rpmbuild -ta libcgroup-X.YY.rcZ.tar.gz'), fix
	   errors in dist/libcgroup.spec.in file if something goes wrong.
	f. Tag the pre-release in git.
	g. Publish the pre-release libcgroup-X.YY.rcZ.tar.gz and announce it on
	   the libgroup-devel list with a changelog (git shortlog A..B is your
           friend).
	h. Test the pre-release and go to a) if new one is needed.
	During this period, ABI of newly introduced shared symbols is *not*
	stable and may change, if there is very good reason to break it.

5. Finally release official version using the same procedure as in step 3.,
   only without the .rcZ version number suffix.
6. Update topic on #libcgroup IRC channel.
