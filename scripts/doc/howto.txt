initscripts - Initialization scripts; they are used to initialize the workload
management system. The script consists of two major components

Configuration files
-------------------

The main configuraiton file /etc/wlm.conf. This file has a format

mount <mountpoint>	<list of controllers>
<controller>		<controller configuration file>

A sample configuration file is included below

#
# controller    file
#
mount   /container      cpu
cpu     /etc/wlm/cpu.conf

NOTE: Any line beginning with '#' is ignored as comments. The sample
configuration above, mounts the cpu controller at mount point /container.
It then parses /etc/wlm/cpu.conf as the configuration file for the
cpu controller.

The controller configuration file is of the format

<name of the class>	<options>

In the case of the CPU controller a sample configuration would look
like

class1  cpu.shares=1024
class2  cpu.shares=512

The configuration below creates two classes class1 and class2 and
assigns shares of 1024 to class1 and 512 to class1.

Intialization script
--------------------

The initialization script is installed in /etc/init.d, it is called
"wlm". Depending on the run-level, it is installed in the appropriate
/etc/rc.d/rc<N>.d. The script comes with two options

a. start

start, starts the workload management, parses the configuration file.
If required creates the mount point directory and then mounts the
cgroup filesystem with the controllers specified.

b. stop

stops workload management, moves all tasks from various groups to
the root class. It then removes all other classes and then unmounts
the workload management system.

Assumptions
-----------

1. The kernel is compiled in with the correct options to support
    cgroups and the CPU controller.
2. This version has been tested with 2.6.24-rc1 only.
